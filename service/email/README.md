# Payment Gateway Email Service

## Overview

`EmailService` is a monolith designed to handle **asynchronous email delivery** triggered by events from other services via **Kafka**. It is responsible for processing events such as OTP codes, registration confirmations, transaction notifications, and merchant status updates, and then sending the corresponding emails via SMTP.


This service is event-driven, meaning it reacts to messages produced to specific Kafka topics, decoupling it from the services that generate those events.


### 📊 Monitoring & Observability

#### Prometheus Metrics
  - email_service_requests_total{method, status}
    → Total number of email requests by method and response status.
  - email_service_request_duration_seconds{method}
    → Histogram tracking how long each email sending process takes.

#### OpenTelemetry Tracing
Each service is assigned a tracer for distributed tracing:
- `email-service`
